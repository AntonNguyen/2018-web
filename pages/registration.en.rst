Corporate & Contributor
=======================

All conference attendees including event chair, volunteers, speakers pays for PyCon registration. This is beloved philosophy of PyCon. That way, we can achieve the attendees be part of the conference with equal status. `Everybody Pays <http://jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays>`_

However, this philosophy might be a barrier to someone who can not afford for the ticket or expense of traveling. To mitigate this, PyCon Canada provides financial aid to help people attend PyCon.

Financial aid recipients have some part of their expenses, which may include registration, travel or accomodation, paid from PyCon budget. While we can't cover all expenses for everyone, we try our hardest to optimally allocate our budget. All Contributor and Corporate tickets sales would go to financial aid fund.
